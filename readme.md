## Joseph Tibbertsma's Personal Website

This actually turned out a lot better than what I had envinsioned.
It's called the primordial ooze because if you sit there and play
with it enough, it will start to self perpetuate. And once it does
that, it's nearly impossible to break the symmetry.

I'm planning on making this into my personal website. I'll have
a div in the center that shows my personal information; at first
glance, it'll just be a fairly boring page with a gray background,
but if you scroll over the background you'll get the color explosion
effect. I'll also have a button that hides the center div so that
you can just play with the background.
